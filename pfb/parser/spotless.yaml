    #   - 0
    #   - 1
    #   - 2

      How to apply positivity constraint
      0 -> no positivity,
      1 -> normal positivity constraint
      and 2 -> strong positivity i.e. all pixels in a band > 0

    abbreviation: niter
    info:
      Number of iterations.

    default: 0.5
    info:
      Lower the initial rmsfactor by this amount
  diverge-count:
    dtype: int
    default: 5
    info:
      Will terminate the algorithm if the rms increases this many times.
      Set to larger than niter to disable this check.

    abbreviation: psfo
    info:
      Size of PSF relative to dirty image
  filter-counts-level:
    dtype: float
    default: 5.0
    info:
      Set minimum counts in the uniform weighting grid to the median divided by this value.
      This is useful to avoid artificially up-weighting nearly empty uv-cells.
  target:
    dtype: str
    info:
      This can be predefined celestial objects known to astropy or a string in
      the format 'HH:MM:SS,DD:MM:SS' (note the , delimiter)
  concat:
    dtype: bool
    default: true
    info:
      Concatenate datasets by row/time.
      This will result in a single dirty image, psf and beam per band.
  mf-weighting:
    dtype: bool
    default: false
    info:
      Base the imaging weights on the uniform weights computed over all
      data instead of per band. This ensures that the MFS image can truly
      be uniformly weighted.
  l2-reweight-from:
    dtype: int
    default: 10
    info:
      Start doing L2 reweights from this iteration onwards.
      L2 reweights will also be triggered if the algorithm
      converges, L1 reweighting has already kicked in and
      l2-reweight-dof is set.
